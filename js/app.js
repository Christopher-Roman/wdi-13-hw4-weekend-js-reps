// console.log('Homework!!')

// Q & A

// 1. We assign a variable by declaring it within the js document.
// 	  You can declare a variable with var, let, or const. Each one 
// 	  has its uses except var... never use var... you can also declare
//	  the variable without any of these, but that's like declaring it
//	  var. Don't do it.

// 2. If you declare your variable with let, you can redeclare it later
//	  in your code to have another value by simply rewriting it or by
//	  manipulating the data within it using various means. If
//	  you declare it with const, you can only update the value by
//	  manipulating the data inside of it. It cannot be redeclared

// 3. You can say "const newVariable = existingVariable" or use let.

// 4. to declare a variable is to state it within your code (i.e let variable)
//	  assiging a variable is giving another variable the value of one that has
//	  already been defined. Defining a variable is giving a variable a value.

// 5. Psuedocodeing is writing out in plain english what you are trying to 
//	  make happen to plan out a way to tackle the thing you are trying
//	  to make the code do. It's like writing an outline before you write
//	  a book.

// 6. 75% to 90% of your time should be spent planning how to do something
//	  10% to 25% should be spent typing code.

//	Strings

let firstVariable = "Hello World";

firstVariable = 34874;

let secondVariable = firstVariable;

secondVariable = 'This is really fun...'

//	secondVariable will console.log the last thing that was done to it. So, it will print out 'This is really fun...'

const yourName = 'Chris';

console.log('Hello, my name is ' + yourName);

// Booleans

  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kevin';

  console.log(a < b);
  console.log(c > d);
  console.log('Name' === 'Name');
  console.log(true !== false);
  console.log(false + false + false + false + false + false !== true);
  console.log(false === false)
  console.log(e === 'Kevin');
  console.log(a + b === c);
  console.log(a * a === d);
  console.log(48 == '48');
